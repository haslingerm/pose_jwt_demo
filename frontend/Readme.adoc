= JWT Demo -- Frontend

This angular project shows how to:

* Retrieve a JWT from a backend server
* Store access token and refresh token in local storage
** An HTTP-only cookie (only sent to the refresh url) would also be a sensible option!
* Intercept the HTTP requests and add the access token to the headers
* Automatically refresh the access token when it expires
** One could add a timer here as well, but there should be some timeout at least

Built for Angular 18 zoneless mode.
