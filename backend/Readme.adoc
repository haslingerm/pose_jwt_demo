= JWT Demo -- Backend

Creates and stores JWT and refresh tokens for users.
A simple SQLite database is used to store data, so this project can be run as-is without any additional setup.

TIP: Take a look at link:./JwtDemo.http[`JwtDemo.http`] for a full run through all the endpoints (creating user, logging in, retrieving data, refreshing token).

No production grade security is implemented in this demo!
Just some sensible defaults -- except for the one endpoint that allows users to register as administrators, that one is just plain evil ðŸ˜‰.
Also, there is no validation, no logging and not the cleanst architecture -- take those parts from other, dedicated examples!

Take it as a starting point for your own implementation.
